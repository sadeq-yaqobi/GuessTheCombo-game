# GuessTheCombo-game
GuessTheCombo-game is a JavaScript game where players attempt to guess a secret combination of numbers. This project aims to provide an entertaining and challenging gaming experience. The game is built using ‍‍`Bootstrap`, a popular front-end framework, to enhance the user interface and provide a responsive design.

## How the Game Works
The game follows a simple set of rules:

1. At the start of each round, a secret combination of numbers is generated by the computer. The combination consists of a sequence of digits, for example, "1234".

2. The player's objective is to guess the secret combination within a limited number of attempts. The default number of attempts is set to 10, but this can be adjusted as per your preference.

3. For each attempt, the player enters a combination of numbers. The game will provide feedback based on the correctness of the guess.

4. When the player guesses the number correctly, the guessed number is highlighted with a green background to indicate a correct guess.

    1. If the guess is lower than the hidden number, the guessed number is highlighted with a blue background.
     2. This indicates that the player should choose a higher number in their next guess.
    3. Conversely, if the guess is higher than the hidden number, the guessed number is highlighted with a red background. This indicates that the player should choose a smaller number in their next guess.

These visual cues help the player in narrowing down their guesses to eventually determine the correct hidden number.
